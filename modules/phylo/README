The purpose of this module is to be able to use the outputs of saturnV to generate:
(1) a core genome phylogeny based on the SNPs found in the core genomes
(2) build a phylogeny based on the presence/absence of genes

Let's start with the path (1).
--STEP 1: extract the 1:1 core genes, i.e. the clusters of core genes for which in each genome we find one and only one gene:
satv_extract-core11-seqs -tab <table> -d <dir_seqs> -ext <file_extension>

example:
satv_extract-core11-seqs -tab table_linked5_strictest.tsv -d ffn/ -ext ffn

NOTE: The script creates the directory "core11_genes".

--STEP2: align the sequences and retain only the positions that are phylogenetically relevant (the ones where there are SNPs).
The alignments are calculated using Prank. The trimming step is performed using BMGE.

Let's create a folder for the alignments
mkdir alignments
and move inside this directory:
cd alignments

then let's launch the command to get the alignments:
satv_align-and-trim-core-genes -d <dir_seqs_genes> -c <n_cpu>

example:
satv_align-and-trim-core-genes -d ../core11_genes -c 32

NOTE: it is important to make sure to read the report of the missing files and make sure all files are there. If some files have not been generated (it can happen, usually due to Prank), please run Prank and BMGE manually for each one of the missing files:
* prank -d=../core11_genes/<line_number>.fasta -o=line_<line_number>.aln -codon -F
* java -jar <path_to_BMGE.jar> -i line_<line_number>.aln.best.fas -t DNA -m ID -h 0.0005:1 -of line_<line_number>.trim.aln -oh line_<line_number>.trim.html


--STEP 3: preprare the data to generate the tree. The alignments are concatenated using phyutility and the rusulting file (all.trim.aln.nex) is converted in phylip format using seqmagick.


NOTE: problem if names > 10 characters


--STEP 4: generate the tree.
