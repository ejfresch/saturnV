0 - INTRODUCTION
-----------------
SaturnV is a software that allows to compare two or more genomes in order to determine and study the core and accessory genomes. The core genome is the set of genes that are present in all genomes of a given dataset. Unique genes (those present in one genome only) and shared genes (those present in more than one genome) constitute the accessory genome. Presence and absence of genes is estimated 

Our software is named after the rocket that brought humankind to the Moon in 1969. A bit like its space couterpart, SaturnV relies on several modules that have to function one after the other in order to achieve the objectives of the mission: determining, comparing and displaying core and accessory genomes.  


1 - INSTALLATION
-----------------
Here is the complete list of dependencies that we are asking you to install in order to run SaturnV. It might seem a lot but these software are anyway needed if you want to study bacterial genomes.
* perl + 3 perl libraries ()
* prokka 
* blastp
* usearch 
* contiguator
* raxml
* R + 2 R libraries ()
* mummer

Do not worry. It is not complicated!
